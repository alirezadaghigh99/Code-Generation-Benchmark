    Data class to store blending params with defaults

    Members:
        sigma (float): For SoftmaxPhong, controls the width of the sigmoid
            function used to calculate the 2D distance based probability. Determines
            the sharpness of the edges of the shape. Higher => faces have less defined
            edges. For SplatterPhong, this is the standard deviation of the Gaussian
            kernel. Higher => splats have a stronger effect and the rendered image is
            more blurry.
        gamma (float): Controls the scaling of the exponential function used
            to set the opacity of the color.
            Higher => faces are more transparent.
        background_color: RGB values for the background color as a tuple or
            as a tensor of three floats.
