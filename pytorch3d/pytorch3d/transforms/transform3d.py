        Use this transform to transform a set of 3D points. Assumes row major
        ordering of the input points.

        Args:
            points: Tensor of shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3)
            eps: If eps!=None, the argument is used to clamp the
                last coordinate before performing the final division.
                The clamping corresponds to:
                last_coord := (last_coord.sign() + (last_coord==0)) *
                torch.clamp(last_coord.abs(), eps),
                i.e. the last coordinates that are exactly 0 will
                be clamped to +eps.

        Returns:
