    """
    Convert a batch of logarithmic representations of rotation matrices `log_rot`
    to a batch of 3x3 rotation matrices using Rodrigues formula [1].

    In the logarithmic representation, each rotation matrix is represented as
    a 3-dimensional vector (`log_rot`) who's l2-norm and direction correspond
    to the magnitude of the rotation angle and the axis of rotation respectively.

    The conversion has a singularity around `log(R) = 0`
    which is handled by clamping controlled with the `eps` argument.

    Args:
        log_rot: Batch of vectors of shape `(minibatch, 3)`.
        eps: A float constant handling the conversion singularity.

    Returns:
        Batch of rotation matrices of shape `(minibatch, 3, 3)`.

    Raises:
        ValueError if `log_rot` is of incorrect shape.
