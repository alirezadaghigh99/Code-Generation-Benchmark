class PIDController(
    AbstractAdaptiveStepSizeController[_PidState, Optional[RealScalarLike]]
):
    r"""Adapts the step size to produce a solution accurate to a given tolerance.
    The tolerance is calculated as `atol + rtol * y` for the evolving solution `y`.

    Steps are adapted using a PID controller.

    ??? tip "Choosing tolerances"

        The choice of `rtol` and `atol` are used to determine how accurately you would
        like the numerical approximation to your equation.

        Typically this is something you already know; or alternatively something for
        which you try a few different values of `rtol` and `atol` until you are getting
        good enough solutions.

        If you're not sure, then a good default for easy ("non-stiff") problems is
        often something like `rtol=1e-3`, `atol=1e-6`. When more accurate solutions
        are required then something like `rtol=1e-7`, `atol=1e-9` are typical (along
        with using `float64` instead of `float32`).

        (Note that technically speaking, the meaning of `rtol` and `atol` is entirely
        dependent on the choice of `solver`. In practice however, most solvers tend to
        provide similar behaviour for similar values of `rtol`, `atol`. As such it is
        common to refer to solving an equation to specific tolerances, without
        necessarily stating which solver was used.)

        ??? Example

            The choice of `rtol` and `atol` can have a significant impact on the
            accuracy of even simple systems.
            Consider a simple pendulum with a small angle kick:
            ```python
            import diffrax as dfx

            def dynamics(t, y, args):
                dtheta = y["omega"]
                domega = - jnp.sin(y["theta"])
                return dict(theta=dtheta, omega=domega)

            y0 = dict(theta=0.1, omega=0)
            term = dfx.ODETerm(dynamics)
            sol = dfx.diffeqsolve(
                term, solver, t0=0, t1=1000, dt0=0.1, y0,
                saveat=dfx.SaveAts(ts=jnp.linspace(0, 1000, 10000),
                max_steps=2**20,
                stepsize_controller=...
            )
            ```
            to compare the effect of different tolerances:
            ```python
            PID_controller_incorrect = diffrax.PIDController(rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-6)
            PID_controller_correct = diffrax.PIDController(rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-9)
            Constant_controller = diffrax.ConstantStepSize()
            ```
            The phase portraits of the pendulum from the different tolerances clearly
            illustrate the impact of the choice of `rtol` and `atol` on the accuracy of
            the solution.

    ??? tip "Choosing PID coefficients"

        This controller can be reduced to any special case (e.g. just a PI controller,
        or just an I controller) by setting `pcoeff`, `icoeff` or `dcoeff` to zero
        as appropriate.

        For smoothly-varying (i.e. easy to solve) problems then an I controller, or a
        PI controller with `icoeff=1`, will often be most efficient.
        ```python
        PIDController(pcoeff=0,   icoeff=1, dcoeff=0)  # default coefficients
        PIDController(pcoeff=0.4, icoeff=1, dcoeff=0)
        ```

        For moderate difficulty problems that may have an error estimate that does
        not vary smoothly, then a less sensitive controller will often do well. (This
        includes many mildly stiff problems.) Several different coefficients are
        suggested in the literature, e.g.
        ```python
        PIDController(pcoeff=0.4, icoeff=0.3, dcoeff=0)
        PIDController(pcoeff=0.3, icoeff=0.3, dcoeff=0)
        PIDController(pcoeff=0.2, icoeff=0.4, dcoeff=0)
        ```

        For SDEs (an extreme example of a problem type that does not have smooth
        behaviour) then an insensitive PI controller is recommended. For example:
        ```python
        PIDController(pcoeff=0.1, icoeff=0.3, dcoeff=0)
        ```

        The best choice is largely empirical, and problem/solver dependent. For most
        moderately difficult ODE problems it is recommended to try tuning these
        coefficients subject to `pcoeff>=0.2`, `icoeff>=0.3`, `pcoeff + icoeff <= 0.7`.
        You can check the number of steps made via:
        ```python
        sol = diffeqsolve(...)
        print(sol.stats["num_steps"])
        ```

            # gradient through the multiplicative factor updating the step size, and
            # the following discussion is in reference to them both, collectively.)
            #
            # - This dramatically speeds up gradient computations. e.g. at time of
            #   writing, the neural ODE example goes from 0.3 seconds/iteration down to
            #   0.1 seconds/iteration.
            # - On some problems this actually improves training behaviour. e.g. at
            #   time of writing, the neural CDE example fails to train if these
            #   stop_gradients are removed.
            # - I've never observed this hurting training behaviour.
            # - Other libraries (notably torchdiffeq) do this by default without
            #   remark. The idea is that "morally speaking" the time discretisation
            #   shouldn't really matter, it's just some minor implementation detail of
            #   the ODE solve. (e.g. part of the folklore of neural ODEs is that "you
            #   don't need to backpropagate through rejected steps".)
            #
            # However:
            # - This feels morally wrong from the point of view of differentiable
            #   programming.
            # - That "you don't need to backpropagate through rejected steps" feels a
            #   bit questionable. They _are_ part of the computational graph and do
            #   have a subtle effect on the choice of step size, and the choice of step
            #   step size does have a not-so-subtle effect on the solution computed.
            # - This does mean that certain esoteric optimisation criteria, like
            #   optimising wrt parameters of the adaptive step size controller itself,
            #   might fail?
            # - It's entirely opaque why these stop_gradients should either improve the
            #   speed of backpropagation, or why they should improve training behavior.
