    r"""Returns a function that computes the metric tensor of a given QNode or quantum tape.

    The metric tensor convention we employ here has the following form:

    .. math::

        \text{metric_tensor}_{i, j} = \text{Re}\left[ \langle \partial_i \psi(\bm{\theta}) | \partial_j \psi(\bm{\theta}) \rangle
        - \langle \partial_i \psi(\bm{\theta}) | \psi(\bm{\theta}) \rangle \langle \psi(\bm{\theta}) | \partial_j \psi(\bm{\theta}) \rangle \right]

    with short notation :math:`| \partial_j \psi(\bm{\theta}) \rangle := \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}| \psi(\bm{\theta}) \rangle`.
    It is closely related to the quantum fisher information matrix, see :func:`~.pennylane.qinfo.transforms.quantum_fisher` and eq. (27) in `arxiv:2103.15191 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15191>`_.

    .. note::

        Only gates that have a single parameter and define a ``generator`` are supported.
        All other parametrized gates will be decomposed if possible.

        The ``generator`` of all parametrized operations, with respect to which the
        tensor is computed, are assumed to be Hermitian.
        This is the case for unitary single-parameter operations.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape): quantum circuit to find the metric tensor of
        argnum (int or Sequence[int] or None): Trainable tape-parameter indices with respect to which
            the metric tensor is computed. If ``argnum=None``, the metric tensor with respect to all
            trainable parameters is returned. Excluding tape-parameter indices from this list reduces
            the computational cost and the corresponding metric-tensor elements will be set to 0.

        approx (str): Which approximation of the metric tensor to compute.

            - If ``None``, the full metric tensor is computed

            - If ``"block-diag"``, the block-diagonal approximation is computed, reducing
              the number of evaluated circuits significantly.

            - If ``"diag"``, only the diagonal approximation is computed, slightly
              reducing the classical overhead but not the quantum resources
              (compared to ``"block-diag"``).

        allow_nonunitary (bool): Whether non-unitary operations are allowed in circuits
            created by the transform. Only relevant if ``approx`` is ``None``.
            Should be set to ``True`` if possible to reduce cost.
        aux_wire (None or int or str or Sequence or pennylane.wires.Wires): Auxiliary wire to
            be used for Hadamard tests. If ``None`` (the default), a suitable wire is inferred
            from the (number of) used wires in the original circuit and ``device_wires``,
            if the latter are given.
        device_wires (.wires.Wires): Wires of the device that is going to be used for the
            metric tensor. Facilitates finding a default for ``aux_wire`` if ``aux_wire``
            is ``None``.
        hybrid (bool): Specifies whether classical processing inside a QNode
            should be taken into account when transforming a QNode.

            - If ``True``, and classical processing is detected, the Jacobian of the classical
              processing will be computed and included. When evaluated, the
              returned metric tensor will be with respect to the QNode arguments.
              The output shape can vary widely.

            - If ``False``, any internal QNode classical processing will be
              **ignored**. When evaluated, the returned metric tensor will be with
              respect to the **gate** arguments, and not the QNode arguments.
              The output shape is a single two-dimensional tensor.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:

        The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`. Executing this circuit
        will provide the metric tensor in the form of a tensor.

    The block-diagonal part of the metric tensor always is computed using the
    covariance-based approach. If no approximation is selected,
    the off block-diagonal is computed using Hadamard tests.

    .. warning::

        Performing the Hadamard tests requires a device
        that has an additional wire as compared to the wires on which the
        original circuit was defined. This wire may be specified via ``aux_wire``.
        The available wires on the device may be specified via ``device_wires``.

        By default (that is, if ``device_wires=None`` ), contiguous wire
        numbering and usage is assumed and the additional
        wire is set to the next wire of the device after the circuit wires.

        If the given or inferred ``aux_wire`` does not exist on the device,
        a warning is raised and the block-diagonal approximation is computed instead.
        It is significantly cheaper in this case to explicitly set ``approx="block-diag"`` .

    The flag ``allow_nonunitary`` should be set to ``True`` whenever the device with
    which the metric tensor is computed supports non-unitary operations.
    This will avoid additional decompositions of gates, in turn avoiding a potentially
    large number of additional Hadamard test circuits to be run.
    State vector simulators, for example, often allow applying operations that are
    not unitary.
    On a real QPU, setting this flag to ``True`` may cause exceptions because the
    computation of the metric tensor will request invalid operations on a quantum
    device.

    **Example**

    Consider the following QNode:

    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

        @qml.qnode(dev, interface="autograd")
        def circuit(weights):
            qml.RX(weights[0], wires=0)
            qml.RY(weights[1], wires=0)
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            qml.RZ(weights[2], wires=1)
            qml.RZ(weights[3], wires=0)
            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)), qml.expval(qml.Y(1))

    We can use the ``metric_tensor`` transform to generate a new function that returns the
    metric tensor of this QNode:

    >>> mt_fn = qml.metric_tensor(circuit)
    >>> weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
    >>> mt_fn(weights)
    tensor([[ 0.25  ,  0.    , -0.0497, -0.0497],
            [ 0.    ,  0.2475,  0.0243,  0.0243],
            [-0.0497,  0.0243,  0.0123,  0.0123],
            [-0.0497,  0.0243,  0.0123,  0.0123]], requires_grad=True)

    In order to save cost, one might want to compute only the block-diagonal part of
    the metric tensor, which requires significantly fewer executions of quantum functions
    and does not need an auxiliary wire on the device. This can be done using the
    ``approx`` keyword:

    >>> mt_fn = qml.metric_tensor(circuit, approx="block-diag")
    >>> weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
    >>> mt_fn(weights)
    tensor([[0.25  , 0.    , 0.    , 0.    ],
            [0.    , 0.2475, 0.    , 0.    ],
            [0.    , 0.    , 0.0123, 0.0123],
            [0.    , 0.    , 0.0123, 0.0123]], requires_grad=True)

    These blocks are given by parameter groups that belong to groups of commuting gates.

    The tensor can be further restricted to the diagonal via ``approx="diag"``. However,
    this will not save further quantum function evolutions but only classical postprocessing.

    The returned metric tensor is also fully differentiable in all interfaces.
    For example, we can compute the gradient of the Frobenius norm of the metric tensor
    with respect to the QNode ``weights`` :

    >>> norm_fn = lambda x: qml.math.linalg.norm(mt_fn(x), ord="fro")
    >>> grad_fn = qml.grad(norm_fn)
    >>> grad_fn(weights)
    array([-0.0282246 ,  0.01340413,  0.        ,  0.        ])

    .. details::
        :title: Usage Details

        This transform can also be applied to low-level
        :class:`~.QuantumTape` objects. This will result in no implicit quantum
        device evaluation. Instead, the processed tapes, and post-processing
        function, which together define the metric tensor are directly returned:

        >>> params = np.array([1.7, 1.0, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
        >>> ops = [
        ...     qml.RX(params[0], wires=0),
        ...     qml.RY(params[1], wires=0),
        ...     qml.CNOT(wires=(0,1)),
        ...     qml.PhaseShift(params[2], wires=1),
        ...     ]
        >>> measurements = [qml.expval(qml.X(0))]
        >>> tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops, measurements)
        >>> tapes, fn = qml.metric_tensor(tape)
        >>> tapes
        [<QuantumTape: wires=[0, 1], params=0>,
         <QuantumTape: wires=[0, 1], params=1>,
         <QuantumTape: wires=[0, 1], params=3>,
         <QuantumTape: wires=[2, 0], params=1>,
         <QuantumTape: wires=[2, 0, 1], params=2>,
         <QuantumTape: wires=[2, 0, 1], params=2>]

        This can be useful if the underlying circuits representing the metric tensor
        computation need to be analyzed. We clearly can distinguish the first three
        tapes used for the block-diagonal from the last three tapes that use the
        auxiliary wire ``2`` , which was not used by the original tape.

        The output tapes can then be evaluated and post-processed to retrieve
        the metric tensor:

        >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
        >>> fn(qml.execute(tapes, dev, None))
        tensor([[ 0.25      ,  0.        ,  0.42073549],
                [ 0.        ,  0.00415023, -0.26517488],
                [ 0.42073549, -0.26517488,  0.24878844]], requires_grad=True)

        The first term of the off block-diagonal entries of the full metric tensor are
        computed with Hadamard tests. This first term reads

        .. math ::

            \mathfrak{Re}\left\{\langle \partial_i\psi|\partial_j\psi\rangle\right\}

        and can be computed using an augmented circuit with an additional qubit.
        See for example the appendix of `McArdle et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-019-0187-2>`__
        for details.
        The block-diagonal of the tensor is computed using the covariance matrix approach.

        In addition, we may extract the factors for the second terms
        :math:`\langle \psi|\partial_j\psi\rangle`
        of the *off block-diagonal* tensor from the quantum function output for the covariance matrix!

        This means that in total only the tapes for the first terms of the off block-diagonal
        are required in addition to the circuits for the block diagonal.

        .. warning::

            The ``argnum`` argument can be used to restrict the parameters which are taken into account
            for computing the metric tensor.
            When the metric tensor of a QNode is computed, the ordering of the parameters has to be
            specified as they appear in the corresponding QuantumTape.

        **Example**

        Consider the following QNode in which parameters are used out of order:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)
            >>> @qml.qnode(dev, interface="autograd")
            >>> def circuit(weights):  # , extra_weight):
            ...     qml.RX(weights[1], wires=0)
            ...     qml.RY(weights[0], wires=0)
            ...     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
            ...     qml.RZ(weights[2], wires=1)
            ...     qml.RZ(weights[3], wires=0)
            ...     return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))

            >>> weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5], requires_grad=True)
            >>> mt = qml.metric_tensor(circuit, argnum=(0, 2, 3))(weights)
            >>> print(mt)
            [[ 0.          0.          0.          0.        ]
             [ 0.          0.25       -0.02495835 -0.02495835]
             [ 0.         -0.02495835  0.01226071  0.01226071]
             [ 0.         -0.02495835  0.01226071  0.01226071]]

        Because the 0-th element of ``weights`` appears second in the QNode and therefore in the
        underlying tape, it is the 1st tape parameter.
        By setting ``argnum = (0, 2, 3)`` we exclude the 0-th element of ``weights`` from the computation
        of the metric tensor and not the 1st element, as one might expect.
