def from_zx(graph, decompose_phases=True):
    """Converts a graph from `PyZX <https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to a PennyLane tape, if the graph is
    diagram-like.

    Args:
        graph (Graph): ZX graph in PyZX.
        decompose_phases (bool): If True the phases are decomposed, meaning that :func:`qml.RZ` and :func:`qml.RX` are
            simplified into other gates (e.g. :func:`qml.T`, :func:`qml.S`, ...).

    **Example**

    From the example for the :func:`~.to_zx` function, one can convert back the PyZX graph to a PennyLane by using the
    function :func:`~.from_zx`.

    .. code-block:: python

        import pyzx
        dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

        @qml.transforms.to_zx
        def circuit(p):
            qml.RZ(p[0], wires=0),
            qml.RZ(p[1], wires=0),
            qml.RX(p[2], wires=1),
            qml.Z(1),
            qml.RZ(p[3], wires=0),
            qml.X(0),
            qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 0]),
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
            qml.SWAP(wires=[1, 0]),
            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1))

        params = [5 / 4 * np.pi, 3 / 4 * np.pi, 0.1, 0.3]
        g = circuit(params)

        pennylane_tape = qml.transforms.from_zx(g)

    You can check that the operations are similar but some were decomposed in the process.

    >>> pennylane_tape.operations
    [Z(0),
     T(wires=[0]),
     RX(0.1, wires=[1]),
     Z(0),
     Adjoint(T(wires=[0])),
     Z(1),
     RZ(0.3, wires=[0]),
     X(0),
     CNOT(wires=[1, 0]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     CNOT(wires=[1, 0]),
     CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
     CNOT(wires=[1, 0])]

    .. warning::

        Be careful because not all graphs are circuit-like, so the process might not be successful
        after you apply some optimization on your PyZX graph. You can extract a circuit by using the dedicated
        PyZX function.

    .. note::

        It is a PennyLane adapted and reworked `graph_to_circuit <https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx/blob/master/pyzx/circuit/graphparser.py>`_
        function.
