    r"""Mitigate an input circuit using zero-noise extrapolation.

    Error mitigation is a precursor to error correction and is compatible with near-term quantum
    devices. It aims to lower the impact of noise when evaluating a circuit on a quantum device by
    evaluating multiple variations of the circuit and post-processing the results into a
    noise-reduced estimate. This transform implements the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method
    originally introduced by
    `Temme et al. <https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.180509>`__ and
    `Li et al. <https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021050>`__.

    Details on the functions passed to the ``folding`` and ``extrapolate`` arguments of this
    transform can be found in the usage details. This transform is compatible with functionality
    from the `Mitiq <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ package (version 0.11.0 and above),
    see the example and usage details for further information.

    Args:
        tape (QNode or QuantumTape): the quantum circuit to be error-mitigated
        scale_factors (Sequence[float]): the range of noise scale factors used
        folding (callable): a function that returns a folded circuit for a specified scale factor
        extrapolate (callable): a function that returns an extrapolated result when provided a
            range of scale factors and corresponding results
        folding_kwargs (dict): optional keyword arguments passed to the ``folding`` function
        extrapolate_kwargs (dict): optional keyword arguments passed to the ``extrapolate`` function
        reps_per_factor (int): Number of circuits generated for each scale factor. Useful when the
            folding function is stochastic.

    Returns:
        qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[.QuantumTape], function]:

        The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qml.transform <pennylane.transform>`. Executing this circuit
        will provide the mitigated results in the form of a tensor of a tensor, a tuple, or a nested tuple depending
        upon the nesting structure of measurements in the original circuit.

    **Example:**

    We first create a noisy device using ``default.mixed`` by adding :class:`~.AmplitudeDamping` to
    each gate of circuits executed on the device using the :func:`~.transforms.insert` transform:

    .. code-block:: python3

        import pennylane as qml

        noise_strength = 0.05

        dev = qml.device("default.mixed", wires=2)
        dev = qml.transforms.insert(qml.AmplitudeDamping, noise_strength)(dev)

    We can now set up a mitigated QNode by passing a ``folding`` and ``extrapolate`` function. PennyLane provides native
    functions :func:`~.pennylane.transforms.fold_global` and :func:`~.pennylane.transforms.poly_extrapolate` or :func:`~.pennylane.transforms.richardson_extrapolate` that
    allow for differentiating through them. Custom functions, as well as functionalities from the `Mitiq <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ package
    are supported as well (see usage details below).

    .. code-block:: python3

        from functools import partial
        from pennylane import numpy as np
        from pennylane import qnode

        from pennylane.transforms import fold_global, poly_extrapolate

        n_wires = 2
        n_layers = 2

        shapes = qml.SimplifiedTwoDesign.shape(n_wires, n_layers)
        np.random.seed(0)
        w1, w2 = [np.random.random(s) for s in shapes]

        @partial(qml.transforms.mitigate_with_zne, [1., 2., 3.], fold_global, poly_extrapolate, extrapolate_kwargs={'order': 2})
        @qnode(dev)
        def circuit(w1, w2):
            qml.SimplifiedTwoDesign(w1, w2, wires=range(2))
            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))

    Executions of ``circuit`` will now be mitigated:

    >>> circuit(w1, w2)
    0.19113067083636542

    The unmitigated circuit result is ``0.33652776`` while the ideal circuit result is
    ``0.23688169`` and we can hence see that mitigation has helped reduce our estimation error.

    This mitigated qnode can be differentiated like any other qnode.

    >>> qml.grad(circuit)(w1, w2)
    (array([-0.89319941,  0.37949841]),
     array([[[-7.04121596e-01,  3.00073104e-01]],
            [[-6.41155176e-01,  8.32667268e-17]]]))

        **Theoretical details**

        A summary of ZNE can be found in `LaRose et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417>`__. The
        method works by assuming that the amount of noise present when a circuit is run on a
        noisy device is enumerated by a parameter :math:`\gamma`. Suppose we have an input circuit
        that experiences an amount of noise equal to :math:`\gamma = \gamma_{0}` when executed.
        Ideally, we would like to evaluate the result of the circuit in the :math:`\gamma = 0`
        noise-free setting.

        To do this, we create a family of equivalent circuits whose ideal noise-free value is the
        same as our input circuit. However, when run on a noisy device, each circuit experiences
        a noise equal to :math:`\gamma = s \gamma_{0}` for some scale factor :math:`s`. By
        evaluating the noisy outputs of each circuit, we can extrapolate to :math:`s=0` to estimate
        the result of running a noise-free circuit.

        A key element of ZNE is the ability to run equivalent circuits for a range of scale factors
        :math:`s`. When the noise present in a circuit scales with the number of gates, :math:`s`
        can be varied using `unitary folding <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9259940>`__.
        Unitary folding works by noticing that a unitary :math:`U` is equivalent to
        :math:`U U^{\dagger} U`. This type of transform can be applied to individual gates in the
        circuit or to the whole circuit. When no folding occurs, the scale factor is
        :math:`s=1` and we are running our input circuit. On the other hand, when each gate has been
        folded once, we have tripled the amount of noise in the circuit so that :math:`s=3`. For
        :math:`s \geq 3`, each gate in the circuit will be folded more than once. A typical choice
        of scale parameters is :math:`(1, 2, 3)`.

        **Unitary folding**

        This transform applies ZNE to an input circuit using the unitary folding approach. It
        requires a callable to be passed as the ``folding`` argument with signature

        .. code-block:: python

            fn(circuit, scale_factor, **folding_kwargs)

        where

        - ``circuit`` is a quantum tape,

        - ``scale_factor`` is a float, and

        - ``folding_kwargs`` are optional keyword arguments.

        The output of the function should be the folded circuit as a quantum tape.
        Folding functionality is available from the
        `Mitiq <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ package (version 0.11.0 and above)
        in the
        `zne.scaling.folding <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.scaling.folding>`__
        module.

        .. warning::

            Calculating the gradient of mitigated circuits is not supported when using the Mitiq
            package as a backend for folding or extrapolation.

        **Extrapolation**

        This transform also requires a callable to be passed to the ``extrapolate`` argument that
        returns the extrapolated value(s). Its function should be

        .. code-block:: python

            fn(scale_factors, results, **extrapolate_kwargs)

        where

        - ``scale_factors`` are the ZNE scale factors,

        - ``results`` are the execution results of the circuit at the specified scale
          factors of shape ``(len(scale_factors), len(qnode_returns))``, and

        - ``extrapolate_kwargs`` are optional keyword arguments.

        The output of the extrapolate ``fn`` should be a flat array of
        length ``len(qnode_returns)``.

        Extrapolation functionality is available using ``extrapolate``
        methods of the factories in the
        `mitiq.zne.inference <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.inference>`__
        module.
