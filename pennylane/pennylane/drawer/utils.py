def cwire_connections(layers, bit_map):
    """Extract the information required for classical control wires.

    Args:
        layers (List[List[.Operator, .MeasurementProcess]]): the operations and measurements sorted
            into layers via ``drawable_layers``. Measurement layers may be appended to operation layers.
        bit_map (Dict): Dictionary containing mid-circuit measurements that are used for
            classical conditions or measurement statistics as keys.

    Returns:
        list, list: list of list of accessed layers for each classical wire, and largest wire
        corresponding to the accessed layers in the list above.

    From this information, we can see that the first classical wire is active in layers
    0, 2, and 3 while the second classical wire is active in layers 1 and 2.  The first "active"
    layer will always be the one with the mid circuit measurement.
