def maxcut(graph: Union[nx.Graph, rx.PyGraph]):
    r"""Returns the QAOA cost Hamiltonian and the recommended mixer corresponding to the
    MaxCut problem, for a given graph.

    The goal of the MaxCut problem for a particular graph is to find a partition of nodes into two sets,
    such that the number of edges in the graph with endpoints in different sets is maximized. Formally,
    we wish to find the `cut of the graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(graph_theory)>`__ such
    that the number of edges crossing the cut is maximized.

    The MaxCut cost Hamiltonian is defined as:

    .. math:: H_C \ = \ \frac{1}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E(G)} \big( Z_i Z_j \ - \ \mathbb{I} \big),

    where :math:`G` is a graph, :math:`\mathbb{I}` is the identity, and :math:`Z_i` and :math:`Z_j` are
    the Pauli-Z operators on the :math:`i`-th and :math:`j`-th wire respectively.

    The mixer Hamiltonian returned from :func:`~qaoa.maxcut` is :func:`~qaoa.x_mixer` applied to all wires.

    .. note::

        **Recommended initialization circuit:**
            Even superposition over all basis states

    Args:
        graph (nx.Graph or rx.PyGraph): a graph defining the pairs of wires on which each term of the Hamiltonian acts

    Returns:
        (.Hamiltonian, .Hamiltonian): The cost and mixer Hamiltonians

    **Example**

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> graph = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2)])
    >>> cost_h, mixer_h = qml.qaoa.maxcut(graph)
    >>> print(cost_h)
    0.5 * (Z(0) @ Z(1)) + 0.5 * (Z(1) @ Z(2)) + -0.5 * (I(0) @ I(1)) + -0.5 * (I(1) @ I(2))
    >>> print(mixer_h)
    1 * X(0) + 1 * X(1) + 1 * X(2)

    >>> import rustworkx as rx
    >>> graph = rx.PyGraph()
    >>> graph.add_nodes_from([0, 1, 2])
    >>> graph.add_edges_from([(0, 1,""), (1,2,"")])
    >>> cost_h, mixer_h = qml.qaoa.maxcut(graph)
    >>> print(cost_h)
    0.5 * (Z(0) @ Z(1)) + 0.5 * (Z(1) @ Z(2)) + -0.5 * (I(0) @ I(1)) + -0.5 * (I(1) @ I(2))
    >>> print(mixer_h)
    1 * X(0) + 1 * X(1) + 1 * X(2)
