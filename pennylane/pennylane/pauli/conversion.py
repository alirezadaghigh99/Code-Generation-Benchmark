def pauli_decompose(
    H, hide_identity=False, wire_order=None, pauli=False, check_hermitian=True
) -> Union[Hamiltonian, PauliSentence]:
    r"""Decomposes a Hermitian matrix into a linear combination of Pauli operators.

    Args:
        H (tensor_like[complex]): a Hermitian matrix of dimension :math:`2^n\times 2^n`.
        hide_identity (bool): does not include the Identity observable within
            the tensor products of the decomposition if ``True``.
        wire_order (list[Union[int, str]]): the ordered list of wires with respect
            to which the operator is represented as a matrix.
        pauli (bool): return a :class:`~.PauliSentence` instance if ``True``.
        check_hermitian (bool): check if the provided matrix is Hermitian if ``True``.

    Returns:
        Union[~.Hamiltonian, ~.PauliSentence]: the matrix decomposed as a linear combination
        of Pauli operators, returned either as a :class:`~.Hamiltonian` or :class:`~.PauliSentence`
        instance.

    **Example:**

    We can use this function to compute the Pauli operator decomposition of an arbitrary Hermitian
    matrix:

    >>> A = np.array(
    ... [[-2, -2+1j, -2, -2], [-2-1j,  0,  0, -1], [-2,  0, -2, -1], [-2, -1, -1,  0]])
    >>> H = qml.pauli_decompose(A)
    >>> print(H)
    (-1.5) [I0 X1]
    + (-1.5) [X0 I1]
    + (-1.0) [I0 I1]
    + (-1.0) [I0 Z1]
    + (-1.0) [X0 X1]
    + (-0.5) [I0 Y1]
    + (-0.5) [X0 Z1]
    + (-0.5) [Z0 X1]
    + (-0.5) [Z0 Y1]
    + (1.0) [Y0 Y1]

    We can return a :class:`~.PauliSentence` instance by using the keyword argument ``pauli=True``:

    >>> ps = qml.pauli_decompose(A, pauli=True)
    >>> print(ps)
    -1.0 * I
    + -1.5 * X(1)
    + -0.5 * Y(1)
    + -1.0 * Z(1)
    + -1.5 * X(0)
    + -1.0 * X(0) @ X(1)
    + -0.5 * X(0) @ Z(1)
    + 1.0 * Y(0) @ Y(1)
    + -0.5 * Z(0) @ X(1)
    + -0.5 * Z(0) @ Y(1)

    By default the wires are numbered [0, 1, ..., n], but we can also set custom wires using the
    ``wire_order`` argument:

    >>> ps = qml.pauli_decompose(A, pauli=True, wire_order=['a', 'b'])
    >>> print(ps)
    -1.0 * I
    + -1.5 * X(b)
    + -0.5 * Y(b)
    + -1.0 * Z(b)
    + -1.5 * X(a)
    + -1.0 * X(a) @ X(b)
    + -0.5 * X(a) @ Z(b)
    + 1.0 * Y(a) @ Y(b)
    + -0.5 * Z(a) @ X(b)
    + -0.5 * Z(a) @ Y(b)

        This method internally uses a generalized decomposition routine to convert the matrix to a
        weighted sum of Pauli words acting on :math:`n` qubits in time :math:`O(n 4^n)`. The input
        matrix is written as a quantum state in the computational basis following the
        `channel-state duality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel-state_duality>`_.
        A Bell basis transformation is then performed using the
        `Walsh-Hadamard transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform>`_, after which
        coefficients for each of the :math:`4^n` Pauli words are computed while accounting for the
        phase from each ``PauliY`` term occurring in the word.
