    """Test whether a function is independent of its input arguments,
    both numerically and analytically.

    Args:
        func (callable): Function to be tested
        interface (str): Autodiff framework used by ``func``. Must correspond to one
            of the supported PennyLane interface strings, such as ``"autograd"``,
            ``"tf"``, ``"torch"``, ``"jax"``.
        args (tuple): Positional arguments with respect to which to test
        kwargs (dict): Keyword arguments for ``func`` at which to test;
            the keyword arguments are kept fixed in this test.
        num_pos (int): Number of random positions to test
        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator
        atol (float): Absolute tolerance for comparing the outputs
        rtol (float): Relative tolerance for comparing the outputs
        bounds (tuple[float]): 2-tuple containing limits of the range from which to sample

    Returns:
        bool: Whether ``func`` returns the same output at randomly
        chosen points and is numerically independent of its arguments.

    .. warning::

        This function is experimental.
        As such, it might yield wrong results and might behave
        slightly differently in distinct autodifferentiation frameworks
        for some edge cases.
        For example, a currently known edge case are piecewise
        functions that use classical control and simultaneously
        return (almost) constant output, such as

        .. code-block:: python

            def func(x):
                if abs(x) <1e-5:
                    return x
                else:
                    return 0. * x

    The analytic and numeric tests used are as follows.

    - The analytic test performed depends on the provided ``interface``,
      both in its method and its degree of reliability.

    - For the numeric test, the function is evaluated at a series of random positions,
      and the outputs numerically compared to verify that the output
      is constant.

    .. warning ::

        Currently, no analytic test is available for the PyTorch interface.
        When using PyTorch, a warning will be raised and only the
        numeric test is performed.

    .. note ::

        Due to the structure of ``is_independent``, it is possible that it
        errs on the side of reporting a dependent function to be independent
        (a false positive). However, reporting an independent function to be
        dependent (a false negative) is *highly* unlikely.

    **Example**

    Consider the (linear) function

    .. code-block:: python

        def lin(x, weights=None):
            return np.dot(x, weights)

    This function clearly depends on ``x``. We may check for this via

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> x = np.array([0.2, 9.1, -3.2], requires_grad=True)
        >>> weights = np.array([1.1, -0.7, 1.8], requires_grad=True)
        >>> qml.math.is_independent(lin, "autograd", (x,), {"weights": weights})
        False

    However, the Jacobian will not depend on ``x`` because ``lin`` is a
    linear function:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> jac = qml.jacobian(lin)
        >>> qml.math.is_independent(jac, "autograd", (x,), {"weights": weights})
        True

    Note that a function ``f = lambda x: 0.0 * x`` will be counted as *dependent* on ``x``
    because it does depend on ``x`` *functionally*, even if the value is constant for all ``x``.
    This means that ``is_independent`` is a stronger test than simply verifying functions
    have constant output.
