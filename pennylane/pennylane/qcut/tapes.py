def tape_to_graph(tape: QuantumTape) -> MultiDiGraph:
    """
    Converts a quantum tape to a directed multigraph.

    .. note::

        This operation is designed for use as part of the circuit cutting workflow.
        Check out the :func:`qml.cut_circuit() <pennylane.cut_circuit>` transform for more details.

    Args:
        tape (QuantumTape): tape to be converted into a directed multigraph

    Returns:
        nx.MultiDiGraph: a directed multigraph that captures the circuit structure
        of the input tape. The nodes of the graph are formatted as ``WrappedObj(op)``, where
        ``WrappedObj.obj`` is the operator.

    **Example**

    Consider the following tape:

    .. code-block:: python

        ops = [
            qml.RX(0.4, wires=0),
            qml.RY(0.9, wires=0),
            qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]),
        ]
        measurements = [qml.expval(qml.Z(1))]
        tape = qml.tape.QuantumTape(ops,)

    Its corresponding circuit graph can be found using

    >>> qml.qcut.tape_to_graph(tape)
    <networkx.classes.multidigraph.MultiDiGraph at 0x7fe41cbd7210>
