    An arbitrary unitary on :math:`n` wires is parametrized by :math:`4^n - 1`
    independent real parameters. This templates uses Pauli word rotations to
    parametrize the unitary.

    **Example**

    ArbitraryUnitary can be used as a building block, e.g. to parametrize arbitrary
    two-qubit operations in a circuit:

            where :math:`n` is the number of wires the template acts upon.
