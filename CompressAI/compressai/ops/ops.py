    Rounding with non-zero gradients. Gradients are approximated by replacing
    the derivative by the identity function.

    .. note::

        Implemented with the pytorch `detach()` reparametrization trick:

        `x_round = x_round - x.detach() + x`
    """
    return (torch.round(x) - x).detach() + x
