def nms(boxes: Tensor, scores: Tensor, iou_threshold: float) -> Tensor:
    """
    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).

    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than ``iou_threshold`` with another (higher scoring)
    box.

    If multiple boxes have the exact same score and satisfy the IoU
    criterion with respect to a reference box, the selected box is
    not guaranteed to be the same between CPU and GPU. This is similar
    to the behavior of argsort in PyTorch when repeated values are present.

    Args:
        boxes (Tensor[N, 4])): boxes to perform NMS on. They
            are expected to be in ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` format with ``0 <= x1 < x2`` and
            ``0 <= y1 < y2``.
        scores (Tensor[N]): scores for each one of the boxes
        iou_threshold (float): discards all overlapping boxes with IoU > iou_threshold

    Returns:
        Tensor: int64 tensor with the indices of the elements that have been kept
        by NMS, sorted in decreasing order of scores

    Converts :class:`torch.Tensor` boxes from a given ``in_fmt`` to ``out_fmt``.

    .. note::
        For converting a :class:`torch.Tensor` or a :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes` object
        between different formats,
        consider using :func:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.functional.convert_bounding_box_format` instead.
        Or see the corresponding transform :func:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.ConvertBoundingBoxFormat`.

    Supported ``in_fmt`` and ``out_fmt`` strings are:

    ``'xyxy'``: boxes are represented via corners, x1, y1 being top left and x2, y2 being bottom right.
    This is the format that torchvision utilities expect.

    ``'xywh'``: boxes are represented via corner, width and height, x1, y2 being top left, w, h being width and height.

    ``'cxcywh'``: boxes are represented via centre, width and height, cx, cy being center of box, w, h
    being width and height.

    Args:
        boxes (Tensor[N, 4]): boxes which will be converted.
        in_fmt (str): Input format of given boxes. Supported formats are ['xyxy', 'xywh', 'cxcywh'].
        out_fmt (str): Output format of given boxes. Supported formats are ['xyxy', 'xywh', 'cxcywh']
