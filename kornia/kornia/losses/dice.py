class DiceLoss(nn.Module):
    r"""Criterion that computes Sørensen-Dice Coefficient loss.

    According to [1], we compute the Sørensen-Dice Coefficient as follows:

    .. math::

        \text{Dice}(x, class) = \frac{2 |X| \cap |Y|}{|X| + |Y|}

    Where:
       - :math:`X` expects to be the scores of each class.
       - :math:`Y` expects to be the one-hot tensor with the class labels.

    the loss, is finally computed as:

    .. math::

        \text{loss}(x, class) = 1 - \text{Dice}(x, class)

    Args:
        average:
            Reduction applied in multi-class scenario:
            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the loss across all classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the loss for each class separately and average the metrics across classes.
        eps: Scalar to enforce numerical stabiliy.
        weight: weights for classes with shape :math:`(num\_of\_classes,)`.

    Shape:
        - Pred: :math:`(N, C, H, W)` where C = number of classes.
        - Target: :math:`(N, H, W)` where each value is
          :math:`0 ≤ targets[i] ≤ C-1`.

    Example:
        >>> N = 5  # num_classes
        >>> criterion = DiceLoss()
        >>> pred = torch.randn(1, N, 3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(1, 3, 5, dtype=torch.long).random_(N)
        >>> output = criterion(pred, target)
        >>> output.backward()
