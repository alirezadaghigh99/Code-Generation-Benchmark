        """Incremental fit on a batch of samples.

        This method is expected to be called several times consecutively
        on different chunks of a dataset so as to implement out-of-core
        or online learning.

        This is especially useful when the whole dataset is too big to fit in
        memory at once.

        This method has some performance and numerical stability overhead,
        hence it is better to call partial_fit on chunks of data that are
        as large as possible (as long as fitting in the memory budget) to
        hide the overhead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training vectors, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and
            `n_features` is the number of features.

        y : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
            Target values.

        classes : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
            List of all the classes that can possibly appear in the y vector.

            Must be provided at the first call to partial_fit, can be omitted
            in subsequent calls.

        sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
            Weights applied to individual samples (1. for unweighted).

            .. versionadded:: 0.17

        Returns
        -------
        self : object
            Returns the instance itself.
