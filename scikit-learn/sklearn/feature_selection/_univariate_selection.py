def f_regression(X, y, *, center=True, force_finite=True):
    """Univariate linear regression tests returning F-statistic and p-values.

    Quick linear model for testing the effect of a single regressor,
    sequentially for many regressors.

    This is done in 2 steps:

    1. The cross correlation between each regressor and the target is computed
       using :func:`r_regression` as::

           E[(X[:, i] - mean(X[:, i])) * (y - mean(y))] / (std(X[:, i]) * std(y))

    2. It is converted to an F score and then to a p-value.

    :func:`f_regression` is derived from :func:`r_regression` and will rank
    features in the same order if all the features are positively correlated
    with the target.

    Note however that contrary to :func:`f_regression`, :func:`r_regression`
    values lie in [-1, 1] and can thus be negative. :func:`f_regression` is
    therefore recommended as a feature selection criterion to identify
    potentially predictive feature for a downstream classifier, irrespective of
    the sign of the association with the target variable.

    Furthermore :func:`f_regression` returns p-values while
    :func:`r_regression` does not.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data matrix.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        The target vector.

    center : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to center the data matrix `X` and the target vector `y`.
        By default, `X` and `y` will be centered.

    force_finite : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to force the F-statistics and associated p-values to
        be finite. There are two cases where the F-statistic is expected to not
        be finite:

        - when the target `y` or some features in `X` are constant. In this
          case, the Pearson's R correlation is not defined leading to obtain
          `np.nan` values in the F-statistic and p-value. When
          `force_finite=True`, the F-statistic is set to `0.0` and the
          associated p-value is set to `1.0`.
        - when a feature in `X` is perfectly correlated (or
          anti-correlated) with the target `y`. In this case, the F-statistic
          is expected to be `np.inf`. When `force_finite=True`, the F-statistic
          is set to `np.finfo(dtype).max` and the associated p-value is set to
          `0.0`.

    Returns

        F-statistic for each feature.

    This score can be used to select the `n_features` features with the
    highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must
    contain only **non-negative features** such as booleans or frequencies
    (e.g., term counts in document classification), relative to the classes.

    Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic
    variables, so using this function "weeds out" the features that are the
    most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for
    classification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : {array-like, sparse matrix}
        Sample1, sample2... The sample measurements should be given as
        arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    f_statistic : float
        The computed F-value of the test.
    p_value : float
        The associated p-value from the F-distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal. This
       property is known as homoscedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still be
    possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`scipy.stats.kruskal`_) although
    with some loss of power.

    The algorithm is from Heiman[2], pp.394-7.

    See ``scipy.stats.f_oneway`` that should give the same results while
    being less efficient.
