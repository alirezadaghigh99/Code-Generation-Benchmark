    """Make a scorer from a performance metric or loss function.

    A scorer is a wrapper around an arbitrary metric or loss function that is called
    with the signature `scorer(estimator, X, y_true, **kwargs)`.

    It is accepted in all scikit-learn estimators or functions allowing a `scoring`
    parameter.

    The parameter `response_method` allows to specify which method of the estimator
    should be used to feed the scoring/loss function.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <scoring>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score_func : callable
        Score function (or loss function) with signature
        ``score_func(y, y_pred, **kwargs)``.

    response_method : {"predict_proba", "decision_function", "predict"} or \
            list/tuple of such str, default=None

        Specifies the response method to use get prediction from an estimator
        (i.e. :term:`predict_proba`, :term:`decision_function` or
        :term:`predict`). Possible choices are:

        - if `str`, it corresponds to the name to the method to return;
        - if a list or tuple of `str`, it provides the method names in order of
          preference. The method returned corresponds to the first method in
          the list and which is implemented by `estimator`.
        - if `None`, it is equivalent to `"predict"`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    greater_is_better : bool, default=True
        Whether `score_func` is a score function (default), meaning high is
        good, or a loss function, meaning low is good. In the latter case, the
        scorer object will sign-flip the outcome of the `score_func`.

    needs_proba : bool, default=False
        Whether `score_func` requires `predict_proba` to get probability
        estimates out of a classifier.

        If True, for binary `y_true`, the score function is supposed to accept
        a 1D `y_pred` (i.e., probability of the positive class, shape
        `(n_samples,)`).

        .. deprecated:: 1.4
           `needs_proba` is deprecated in version 1.4 and will be removed in
           1.6. Use `response_method="predict_proba"` instead.

    needs_threshold : bool, default=False
        Whether `score_func` takes a continuous decision certainty.
        This only works for binary classification using estimators that
        have either a `decision_function` or `predict_proba` method.

        If True, for binary `y_true`, the score function is supposed to accept
        a 1D `y_pred` (i.e., probability of the positive class or the decision
        function, shape `(n_samples,)`).

        For example `average_precision` or the area under the roc curve
        can not be computed using discrete predictions alone.

        .. deprecated:: 1.4
           `needs_threshold` is deprecated in version 1.4 and will be removed
           in 1.6. Use `response_method=("decision_function", "predict_proba")`
           instead to preserve the same behaviour.

    **kwargs : additional arguments
        Additional parameters to be passed to `score_func`.

    Returns
    -------
    scorer : callable
        Callable object that returns a scalar score; greater is better.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, make_scorer
    >>> ftwo_scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=2)
    >>> ftwo_scorer
    make_scorer(fbeta_score, response_method='predict', beta=2)
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    >>> from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
    >>> grid = GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(), param_grid={'C': [1, 10]},

def get_scorer(scoring):
    """Get a scorer from string.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <scoring_parameter>`.
    :func:`~sklearn.metrics.get_scorer_names` can be used to retrieve the names
    of all available scorers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scoring : str, callable or None
        Scoring method as string. If callable it is returned as is.
        If None, returns None.

    Returns
    -------
    scorer : callable
        The scorer.

    Notes
    -----
    When passed a string, this function always returns a copy of the scorer
    object. Calling `get_scorer` twice for the same scorer results in two
    separate scorer objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import get_scorer
    >>> X = np.reshape([0, 1, -1, -0.5, 2], (-1, 1))
    >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
    >>> classifier = DummyClassifier(strategy="constant", constant=0).fit(X, y)
    >>> accuracy = get_scorer("accuracy")
    >>> accuracy(classifier, X, y)
