    This is particularly useful during evaluation when you want to make predictions for

    Usually the stride should be slightly smaller than the chip size such that each chip
    has some small overlap with surrounding chips. This is used to prevent `stitching
    artifacts <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12219>`_ when combining each prediction patch.
    The overlap between each chip (``chip_size - stride``) should be approximately equal
    to the `receptive field <https://distill.pub/2019/computing-receptive-fields/>`_ of
    the CNN.
