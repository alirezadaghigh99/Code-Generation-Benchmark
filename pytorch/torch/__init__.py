def set_float32_matmul_precision(precision: str) -> None:
    r"""Sets the internal precision of float32 matrix multiplications.

    Running float32 matrix multiplications in lower precision may significantly increase
    performance, and in some programs the loss of precision has a negligible impact.

    Supports three settings:

        * "highest", float32 matrix multiplications use the float32 datatype (24 mantissa
          bits with 23 bits explicitly stored) for internal computations.
        * "high", float32 matrix multiplications either use the TensorFloat32 datatype (10
          mantissa bits explicitly stored) or treat each float32 number as the sum of two bfloat16 numbers
          (approximately 16 mantissa bits with 14 bits explicitly stored), if the appropriate fast matrix multiplication
          algorithms are available.  Otherwise float32 matrix multiplications are computed
          as if the precision is "highest".  See below for more information on the bfloat16
          approach.
        * "medium", float32 matrix multiplications use the bfloat16 datatype (8 mantissa
          bits with 7 bits explicitly stored) for internal computations, if a fast matrix multiplication algorithm
          using that datatype internally is available. Otherwise float32
          matrix multiplications are computed as if the precision is "high".

    When using "high" precision, float32 multiplications may use a bfloat16-based algorithm
    that is more complicated than simply truncating to some smaller number mantissa bits
    (e.g. 10 for TensorFloat32, 7 for bfloat16 explicitly stored).  Refer to [Henry2019]_ for a complete
    description of this algorithm.  To briefly explain here, the first step is to realize
    that we can perfectly encode a single float32 number as the sum of three bfloat16
    numbers (because float32 has 23 mantissa bits while bfloat16 has 7 explicitly stored, and both have the
    same number of exponent bits).  This means that the product of two float32 numbers can
    be exactly given by the sum of nine products of bfloat16 numbers.  We can then trade
    accuracy for speed by dropping some of these products.  The "high" precision algorithm
    specifically keeps only the three most significant products, which conveniently excludes
    all of the products involving the last 8 mantissa bits of either input.  This means that
    we can represent our inputs as the sum of two bfloat16 numbers rather than three.
    Because bfloat16 fused-multiply-add (FMA) instructions are typically >10x faster than
    float32 ones, it's faster to do three multiplications and 2 additions with bfloat16
    precision than it is to do a single multiplication with float32 precision.

    .. note::

        This does not change the output dtype of float32 matrix multiplications,
        it controls how the internal computation of the matrix multiplication is performed.

    .. note::

        This does not change the precision of convolution operations. Other flags,
        like `torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32`, may control the precision of convolution
        operations.

    .. note::

        This flag currently only affects one native device type: CUDA.
        If "high" or "medium" are set then the TensorFloat32 datatype will be used
        when computing float32 matrix multiplications, equivalent to setting
        `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True`. When "highest" (the default)
        is set then the float32 datatype is used for internal computations, equivalent
        to setting `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False`.

    Args:
        precision(str): can be set to "highest" (default), "high", or "medium" (see above).
