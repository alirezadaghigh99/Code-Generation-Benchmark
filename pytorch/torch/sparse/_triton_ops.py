class TensorAsKey:
    """A light-weight wrapper of a tensor that enables storing tensors as
    keys with efficient memory reference based comparision as an
    approximation to data equality based keys.

    Motivation: the hash value of a torch tensor is tensor instance
    based that does not use data equality and makes the usage of
    tensors as keys less useful. For instance, the result of
    ``len({a.crow_indices(), a.crow_indices()})`` is `2`, although,
    the tensor results from `crow_indices` method call are equal, in
    fact, these share the same data storage.
    On the other hand, for efficient caching of tensors we want to
    avoid calling torch.equal that compares tensors item-wise.

    TensorAsKey offers a compromise in that it guarantees key equality
    of tensors that references data in the same storage in the same
    manner and without accessing underlying data. However, this
    approach does not always guarantee correctness. For instance, for
    a complex tensor ``x``, we have ``TensorAsKey(x) ==
    TensorAsKey(x.conj())`` while ``torch.equal(x, x.conj())`` would
    return False.
