        Moves the storage to shared memory.

        This is a no-op for storages already in shared memory and for CUDA
        storages, which do not need to be moved for sharing across processes.
        Storages in shared memory cannot be resized.

        Note that to mitigate issues like `this <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/95606>`_
        it is thread safe to call this function from multiple threads on the same object.
        It is NOT thread safe though to call any other function on self without proper
        synchronization. Please see :doc:`/notes/multiprocessing` for more details.

        .. note::
            When all references to a storage in shared memory are deleted, the associated shared memory
            object will also be deleted. PyTorch has a special cleanup process to ensure that this happens
            even if the current process exits unexpectedly.

            It is worth noting the difference between :meth:`share_memory_` and :meth:`from_file` with ``shared = True``

            #. ``share_memory_`` uses `shm_open(3) <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html>`_ to create a
               POSIX shared memory object while :meth:`from_file` uses
               `open(2) <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html>`_ to open the filename passed by the user.
            #. Both use an `mmap(2) call <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>`_ with ``MAP_SHARED``
               to map the file/object into the current virtual address space
            #. ``share_memory_`` will call ``shm_unlink(3)`` on the object after mapping it to make sure the shared memory
               object is freed when no process has the object open. ``torch.from_file(shared=True)`` does not unlink the
               file. This file is persistent and will remain until it is deleted by the user.
