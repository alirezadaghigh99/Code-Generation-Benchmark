class Dropout(_DropoutNd):
    r"""During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability :attr:`p`.

    The zeroed elements are chosen independently for each forward call and are sampled from a Bernoulli distribution.

    Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call.

    This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and
    preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper
    `Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature
    detectors`_ .

    Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of :math:`\frac{1}{1-p}` during
    training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
        inplace: If set to ``True``, will do this operation in-place. Default: ``False``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: :math:`(*)`. Output is of the same shape as input

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.Dropout(p=0.2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16)
        >>> output = m(input)
