    r'''
    Load a PyTorch C++ extension just-in-time (JIT) from string sources.

    This function behaves exactly like :func:`load`, but takes its sources as
    strings rather than filenames. These strings are stored to files in the
    build directory, after which the behavior of :func:`load_inline` is
    identical to :func:`load`.

    See `the
    tests <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/test/test_cpp_extensions_jit.py>`_
    for good examples of using this function.

    Sources may omit two required parts of a typical non-inline C++ extension:
    the necessary header includes, as well as the (pybind11) binding code. More
    precisely, strings passed to ``cpp_sources`` are first concatenated into a
    single ``.cpp`` file. This file is then prepended with ``#include
    <torch/extension.h>``.

    Furthermore, if the ``functions`` argument is supplied, bindings will be
    automatically generated for each function specified. ``functions`` can
    either be a list of function names, or a dictionary mapping from function
    names to docstrings. If a list is given, the name of each function is used
    as its docstring.

    The sources in ``cuda_sources`` are concatenated into a separate ``.cu``
    file and  prepended with ``torch/types.h``, ``cuda.h`` and
    ``cuda_runtime.h`` includes. The ``.cpp`` and ``.cu`` files are compiled
    separately, but ultimately linked into a single library. Note that no
    bindings are generated for functions in ``cuda_sources`` per  se. To bind
    to a CUDA kernel, you must create a C++ function that calls it, and either
    declare or define this C++ function in one of the ``cpp_sources`` (and
    include its name in ``functions``).

    See :func:`load` for a description of arguments omitted below.

    Args:
        cpp_sources: A string, or list of strings, containing C++ source code.
        cuda_sources: A string, or list of strings, containing CUDA source code.
        functions: A list of function names for which to generate function
            bindings. If a dictionary is given, it should map function names to
            docstrings (which are otherwise just the function names).
        with_cuda: Determines whether CUDA headers and libraries are added to
            the build. If set to ``None`` (default), this value is
            automatically determined based on whether ``cuda_sources`` is
            provided. Set it to ``True`` to force CUDA headers
            and libraries to be included.
        with_pytorch_error_handling: Determines whether pytorch error and
            warning macros are handled by pytorch instead of pybind. To do
            this, each function ``foo`` is called via an intermediary ``_safe_foo``
            function. This redirection might cause issues in obscure cases
            of cpp. This flag should be set to ``False`` when this redirect
            causes issues.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_CPP_EXT)
        >>> from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline
        >>> source = """
        at::Tensor sin_add(at::Tensor x, at::Tensor y) {
          return x.sin() + y.sin();
        }
        """
        >>> module = load_inline(name='inline_extension',
        ...                      cpp_sources=[source],
        ...                      functions=['sin_add'])

    .. note::
        By default, the Ninja backend uses #CPUS + 2 workers to build the
        extension. This may use up too many resources on some systems. One
        can control the number of workers by setting the `MAX_JOBS` environment
        variable to a non-negative number.

    """
    Load a PyTorch C++ extension just-in-time (JIT).

    To load an extension, a Ninja build file is emitted, which is used to
    compile the given sources into a dynamic library. This library is
    subsequently loaded into the current Python process as a module and
    returned from this function, ready for use.

    By default, the directory to which the build file is emitted and the
    resulting library compiled to is ``<tmp>/torch_extensions/<name>``, where
    ``<tmp>`` is the temporary folder on the current platform and ``<name>``
    the name of the extension. This location can be overridden in two ways.
    First, if the ``TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR`` environment variable is set, it
    replaces ``<tmp>/torch_extensions`` and all extensions will be compiled
    into subfolders of this directory. Second, if the ``build_directory``
    argument to this function is supplied, it overrides the entire path, i.e.
    the library will be compiled into that folder directly.

    To compile the sources, the default system compiler (``c++``) is used,
    which can be overridden by setting the ``CXX`` environment variable. To pass
    additional arguments to the compilation process, ``extra_cflags`` or
    ``extra_ldflags`` can be provided. For example, to compile your extension
    with optimizations, pass ``extra_cflags=['-O3']``. You can also use
    ``extra_cflags`` to pass further include directories.

    CUDA support with mixed compilation is provided. Simply pass CUDA source
    files (``.cu`` or ``.cuh``) along with other sources. Such files will be
    detected and compiled with nvcc rather than the C++ compiler. This includes
    passing the CUDA lib64 directory as a library directory, and linking
    ``cudart``. You can pass additional flags to nvcc via
    ``extra_cuda_cflags``, just like with ``extra_cflags`` for C++. Various
    heuristics for finding the CUDA install directory are used, which usually
    work fine. If not, setting the ``CUDA_HOME`` environment variable is the
    safest option.

    Args:
        name: The name of the extension to build. This MUST be the same as the
            name of the pybind11 module!
        sources: A list of relative or absolute paths to C++ source files.
        extra_cflags: optional list of compiler flags to forward to the build.
        extra_cuda_cflags: optional list of compiler flags to forward to nvcc
            when building CUDA sources.
        extra_ldflags: optional list of linker flags to forward to the build.
        extra_include_paths: optional list of include directories to forward
            to the build.
        build_directory: optional path to use as build workspace.
        verbose: If ``True``, turns on verbose logging of load steps.
        with_cuda: Determines whether CUDA headers and libraries are added to
            the build. If set to ``None`` (default), this value is
            automatically determined based on the existence of ``.cu`` or
            ``.cuh`` in ``sources``. Set it to `True`` to force CUDA headers
            and libraries to be included.
        is_python_module: If ``True`` (default), imports the produced shared
            library as a Python module. If ``False``, behavior depends on
            ``is_standalone``.
        is_standalone: If ``False`` (default) loads the constructed extension
            into the process as a plain dynamic library. If ``True``, build a
            standalone executable.

    Returns:
        If ``is_python_module`` is ``True``:
            Returns the loaded PyTorch extension as a Python module.

        If ``is_python_module`` is ``False`` and ``is_standalone`` is ``False``:
            Returns nothing. (The shared library is loaded into the process as
            a side effect.)

        If ``is_standalone`` is ``True``.
            Return the path to the executable. (On Windows, TORCH_LIB_PATH is
            added to the PATH environment variable as a side effect.)
