        The boxes would be rescaled to the original image scale and do
        the nms operation. Usually `with_nms` is False is used for aug test.

        Args:
            results (:obj:`InstaceData`): Detection instance results,
                each item has shape (num_bboxes, ).
            cfg (mmengine.Config): Test / postprocessing configuration,
                if None, test_cfg would be used.
            rescale (bool): If True, return boxes in original image space.
                Default to False.
            with_nms (bool): If True, do nms before return boxes.
                Default to True.
            img_meta (dict, optional): Image meta info. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            :obj:`InstanceData`: Detection results of each image
            after the post process.
            Each item usually contains following keys.

            - scores (Tensor): Classification scores, has a shape
              (num_instance, )
            - labels (Tensor): Labels of bboxes, has a shape
              (num_instances, ).
            - bboxes (Tensor): Has a shape (num_instances, 4),
